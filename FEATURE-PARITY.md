# Feature Parity: Original (main) → AWS Migration (feature/aws-migration)

Tracks every API endpoint and key feature from the original Supabase-backed codebase (`d969096`) against the current AWS migration. Use this to confirm nothing is silently dropped.

**Status legend:**
- ✅ Migrated — equivalent functionality present
- ⚠️ Changed — present but behaviour differs (noted below)
- ❌ Not yet migrated — missing
- 🚫 Intentionally skipped — dropped with documented reason

## Chat (`/chat`)

| Method | Path | Original | Migrated | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|----------|-------|
| GET | `/` | List user chats | ✅ | |
| POST | `/create` | Create chat row | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:chatId` | Fetch chat + messages + annotations | ✅ | |
| PATCH | `/:chatId` | Update chat metadata | ✅ | |
| DELETE | `/:chatId` | Delete chat | ✅ | Also deletes S3 session objects (AWS addition) |
| POST | `/:chatId/generate-title` | Generate/store title via AI | ✅ | |
| POST | `/` | Stream AI chat (Supabase AI proxy) | ⚠️ | Original proxied to Supabase AI edge function. Migration: frontend calls AgentCore Runtime directly with Cognito JWT. Backend `POST /` removed — not needed in AWS arch |
| GET | `/:chatId/messages` | Fetch messages for a chat | ✅ | Added in migration (was embedded in GET /:chatId in original) |
| GET | `/:chatId/session-id` | Fetch AgentCore session ID | ✅ | New endpoint specific to AWS AgentCore session continuity |

| Method | Path | Original | Migrated | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|----------|-------|
| GET | `/` | List user documents | ✅ | |
| POST | `/prepare` + `/:documentId/register` | Upload document | ✅ | Frontend calls `/prepare` (creates DB row, returns S3 key), uploads directly to S3 via Amplify `uploadData` (Identity Pool creds), then calls `/register` to create version row. Conversion Lambda handles DOCX→PDF via EventBridge. |
| DELETE | `/:documentId` | Delete document + S3 objects | ✅ | |

| POST | `/download-zip` | Download multiple docs as ZIP | ✅ | |

| GET | `/:projectId/documents` | List project documents | ✅ | |
| POST | `/:projectId/documents/prepare` + `/documents/:documentId/register` | Upload doc to project | ✅ | Same direct S3 flow as standalone upload |
| POST | `/:projectId/documents/:documentId` | Add existing doc to project | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:projectId/chats` | List project chats | ✅ | |
| POST | `/:projectId/folders` | Create folder | ✅ | |

| DELETE | `/:projectId/folders/:folderId` | Delete folder | ✅ | |
| PATCH | `/:projectId/documents/:documentId/folder` | Move doc to folder | ✅ | |

**Project chat (originally in `projectChat.ts`):**

| Method | Path | Original | Migrated | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|----------|-------|
| POST | `/` (mounted at `/:projectId/chat`) | Stream project AI chat | ⚠️ | Same as `/chat POST /` — frontend now calls AgentCore directly. Route removed; project context passed via AgentCore invocation payload |

| GET | `/:reviewId/chats` | List review chats | ✅ | |
| DELETE | `/:reviewId/chats/:chatId` | Delete review chat | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:reviewId/chats/:chatId/messages` | Fetch chat messages | ✅ | |
| POST | `/:reviewId/chat` (original) / `/:reviewId/chats` (migrated) | Create chat + stream (original) | ⚠️ | Original: single endpoint proxied AI and persisted. Migration: `POST /chats` pre-creates row; frontend calls AgentCore directly; `POST /chats/:chatId/messages` persists after `[DONE]` |
| POST | `/:reviewId/chats/:chatId/messages` | Persist chat turn | ✅ | New in migration; handles post-stream persistence |

---

## Downloads (`/download`)

| GET | `/:token` | Download file via short-lived token | ⚠️ | Original: HMAC-signed download tokens verified server-side, file streamed through Lambda. Migration: replaced with presigned S3 URLs served via `GET /presigned` and `GET /` — no token system needed |

| GET | `/presigned` | Get presigned S3 URL | ✅ | Replaces token-based approach |

---

## Key Non-Route Features

| Feature | Original | Migrated | Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| Authentication | Supabase Auth (JWT) | ✅ | AWS Cognito User Pool; Amplify Auth v6 on frontend |
| S3 direct upload | No — all uploads proxied through backend | ✅ | Frontend uploads directly via Amplify `uploadData` with Cognito Identity Pool temp credentials; Lambda no longer buffers file bytes |
| Document storage | Supabase Storage | ✅ | AWS S3 with per-user IAM prefix enforcement |
| DOCX→PDF conversion | Inline LibreOffice in backend Lambda | ✅ | Offloaded to dedicated Conversion Lambda (x86_64) triggered by EventBridge S3 rule |
| PDF upload passthrough | No — only DOCX/DOC supported | ✅ | Added: Conversion Lambda detects `.pdf`, copies to `converted-pdfs/` prefix, updates DB |
| AI chat | Supabase AI edge function via backend proxy | ✅ | AWS AgentCore Runtime (Strands agent) with SSE streaming; frontend calls AgentCore directly |
| Credits metering | No | ✅ | DynamoDB `credits_used` per userId+month; `AfterModelCallEvent` tracks `totalTokens` |
| Session persistence | No | ✅ | S3-backed AgentCore session snapshots; session cleanup on chat delete |
| Database | Supabase Postgres | ✅ | Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL via RDS Data API |
| Real-time / subscriptions | Supabase Realtime | 🚫 | Not used in original codebase (no realtime subscriptions found) |
| `documents.structure_tree` | Written on every upload (heading/section extraction) | 🚫 | Column kept in schema but no longer populated. Extraction wasted CPU on every upload; nothing in frontend, backend, or agents ever reads the column. Can be backfilled via batch job if a future feature needs it. See ARCHITECTURE.md → Database section |

## Pending / Open Items

- [ ] **Phase 7 scripts**: `scripts/deploy-agent.sh` and supporting scripts should read CFN outputs dynamically; add `destroy-agent.sh`.
