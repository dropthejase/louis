# Feature Parity: Original (main) → AWS Migration (feature/aws-migration)

Tracks every API endpoint and key feature from the original Supabase-backed codebase (`d969096`) against the current AWS migration. Use this to confirm nothing is silently dropped.

**Status legend:**
- ✅ Migrated — equivalent functionality present
- ⚠️ Changed — present but behaviour differs (noted below)
- ❌ Not yet migrated — missing
- 🚫 Intentionally skipped — dropped with documented reason

## Chat (`/chat`)

| Method | Path | Original | Migrated | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|----------|-------|
| GET | `/` | List user chats | ✅ | |
| POST | `/create` | Create chat row | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:chatId` | Fetch chat + messages + annotations | ✅ | |
| PATCH | `/:chatId` | Update chat metadata | ✅ | |
| DELETE | `/:chatId` | Delete chat | ✅ | Also deletes S3 session objects (AWS addition) |
| POST | `/:chatId/generate-title` | Generate/store title via AI | ✅ | |
| POST | `/` | Stream AI chat (Supabase AI proxy) | ⚠️ | Original proxied to Supabase AI edge function. Migration: frontend calls AgentCore Runtime directly with Cognito JWT. Backend `POST /` removed — not needed in AWS arch |
| GET | `/:chatId/messages` | Fetch messages for a chat | ✅ | Added in migration (was embedded in GET /:chatId in original) |
| GET | `/:chatId/session-id` | Fetch AgentCore session ID | ✅ | New endpoint specific to AWS AgentCore session continuity |
| PUT | `/:chatId/session-id` | Store AgentCore session ID | ✅ | New endpoint specific to AWS AgentCore session continuity |

## Single Documents (`/single-documents`)

| Method | Path | Original | Migrated | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|----------|-------|
| GET | `/` | List user documents | ✅ | |
| POST | `/prepare` + `/:documentId/register` | Upload document | ✅ | Frontend calls `/prepare` (creates DB row, returns S3 key), uploads directly to S3 via Amplify `uploadData` (Identity Pool creds), then calls `/register` to create version row. Conversion Lambda handles DOCX→PDF via EventBridge. |
| DELETE | `/:documentId` | Delete document + S3 objects | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:documentId/display` | Fetch display metadata | ✅ | |
| POST | `/download-zip` | Download multiple docs as ZIP | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:documentId/url` | Get presigned URL for doc | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:documentId/docx` | Stream DOCX bytes | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:documentId/versions` | List document versions | ✅ | |
| POST | `/:documentId/versions` | Create new version | ✅ | |
| PATCH | `/:documentId/versions/:versionId` | Update version metadata | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:documentId/tracked-change-ids` | Fetch tracked change IDs | ✅ | |

| PATCH | `/:projectId` | Update project metadata | ✅ | |
| DELETE | `/:projectId` | Delete project | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:projectId/documents` | List project documents | ✅ | |
| POST | `/:projectId/documents/prepare` + `/documents/:documentId/register` | Upload doc to project | ✅ | Same direct S3 flow as standalone upload |
| POST | `/:projectId/documents/:documentId` | Add existing doc to project | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:projectId/chats` | List project chats | ✅ | |
| POST | `/:projectId/folders` | Create folder | ✅ | |
| PATCH | `/:projectId/folders/:folderId` | Update folder | ✅ | |
| DELETE | `/:projectId/folders/:folderId` | Delete folder | ✅ | |
| PATCH | `/:projectId/documents/:documentId/folder` | Move doc to folder | ✅ | |

**Project chat (originally in `projectChat.ts`):**

| Method | Path | Original | Migrated | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|----------|-------|
| POST | `/` (mounted at `/:projectId/chat`) | Stream project AI chat | ⚠️ | Same as `/chat POST /` — frontend now calls AgentCore directly. Route removed; project context passed via AgentCore invocation payload |

|--------|------|----------|----------|-------|
| GET | `/` | List tabular reviews | ✅ | |

| POST | `/:reviewId/generate` | Generate all cells | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:reviewId/chats` | List review chats | ✅ | |
| DELETE | `/:reviewId/chats/:chatId` | Delete review chat | ✅ | |
| GET | `/:reviewId/chats/:chatId/messages` | Fetch chat messages | ✅ | |
| POST | `/:reviewId/chat` (original) / `/:reviewId/chats` (migrated) | Create chat + stream (original) | ⚠️ | Original: single endpoint proxied AI and persisted. Migration: `POST /chats` pre-creates row; frontend calls AgentCore directly; `POST /chats/:chatId/messages` persists after `[DONE]` |
| POST | `/:reviewId/chats/:chatId/messages` | Persist chat turn | ✅ | New in migration; handles post-stream persistence |

## Workflows (`/workflows`)

| PUT | `/profile` | Update profile | ✅ | New in migration |

---

## Downloads (`/download`)

| Method | Path | Original | Migrated | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|----------|-------|
| GET | `/:token` | Download file via short-lived token | ⚠️ | Original: HMAC-signed download tokens verified server-side, file streamed through Lambda. Migration: replaced with presigned S3 URLs served via `GET /presigned` and `GET /` — no token system needed |
| GET | `/` | List download history | ✅ | New structure |
| GET | `/presigned` | Get presigned S3 URL | ✅ | Replaces token-based approach |

---

## Key Non-Route Features

| Feature | Original | Migrated | Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| Authentication | Supabase Auth (JWT) | ✅ | AWS Cognito User Pool; Amplify Auth v6 on frontend |
| S3 direct upload | No — all uploads proxied through backend | ✅ | Frontend uploads directly via Amplify `uploadData` with Cognito Identity Pool temp credentials; Lambda no longer buffers file bytes |
| Document storage | Supabase Storage | ✅ | AWS S3 with per-user IAM prefix enforcement |
| DOCX→PDF conversion | Inline LibreOffice in backend Lambda | ✅ | Offloaded to dedicated Conversion Lambda (x86_64) triggered by EventBridge S3 rule |
| PDF upload passthrough | No — only DOCX/DOC supported | ✅ | Added: Conversion Lambda detects `.pdf`, copies to `converted-pdfs/` prefix, updates DB |
| AI chat | Supabase AI edge function via backend proxy | ✅ | AWS AgentCore Runtime (Strands agent) with SSE streaming; frontend calls AgentCore directly |
| Credits metering | No | ✅ | DynamoDB `credits_used` per userId+month; `AfterModelCallEvent` tracks `totalTokens` |
| Session persistence | No | ✅ | S3-backed AgentCore session snapshots; session cleanup on chat delete |
| Database | Supabase Postgres | ✅ | Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL via RDS Data API |
| Real-time / subscriptions | Supabase Realtime | 🚫 | Not used in original codebase (no realtime subscriptions found) |
| `documents.structure_tree` | Written on every upload (heading/section extraction) | 🚫 | Column kept in schema but no longer populated. Extraction wasted CPU on every upload; nothing in frontend, backend, or agents ever reads the column. Can be backfilled via batch job if a future feature needs it. See ARCHITECTURE.md → Database section |

## Pending / Open Items

| Area | Gap | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Sidebar — user tier | `main` reads `profile.tier` from DB (`user_profiles.tier` column) and displays it below the user's name (e.g. "Free", "Pro"). Dev hardcodes `"Free"`. | Need to expose `tier` field in `GET /user/profile` response and consume it in the dev `AppSidebar`. |
| Account Settings page | `main` has a dropdown on the sidebar user widget → "Account Settings" page. Dev sidebar has the same dropdown but the Account Settings page content needs parity review. | To be worked next. |
| Credit enforcement | `main` has pre-flight credit check — requests blocked with 429 when credits exhausted. Dev tracks credits (DynamoDB) but no enforcement gate. | See project TODO. |
| Schema cleanup TBD on implementation — `chat_messages` | `chat_messages` table and `document_edits.chat_message_id` column are dead in dev — messages live in S3 snapshots only. `chat_message_id` was never written to in either branch. | Remove from `000_one_shot_schema.sql`: `chat_messages` table + index, `document_edits.chat_message_id` column + `document_edits_message_id_idx` + FK constraint block. Also strip the `chat_messages` query from `GET /chat/:chatId` backend (returns metadata only). `hydrateEditStatuses` already moved to `/messages` endpoint. |
